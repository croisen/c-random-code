# Random Code
Random code for my own fun, and to solve some ctf or other challenges.

## Todo
- [x] Write an argument parser for a main file that runs a solution for a project euler problem.
- [x] Try to solve more project euler problems and add it to the func_exec.h (1-15, 16)
- [ ] Write solutions for some picoCTF problems in c because why not.
- [x] Fix the bash scripts.
- [ ] Finish the code for the creation of the z-table (become proficient at calculus and lib mpfr :( ).
- [ ] Finish the rewrite of the snake game written in python.
