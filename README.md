# Random Code
Random code for my own fun, and to solve some ctf or other challenges.

Is what I say back then, but I guess I just wanna mess around using it

## Building the stuff I made
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/croisen/c-random-code.git"
cd c-random-code/
make
```

## Todo
-   [x] Clear the previous projects (it will be rewritten later)
-   [ ] Write the makefiles to support a PREFIX dir to store the libs and 
        executables
-   [ ] Re-create what I've done, maybe with a bit more understanding
-   [ ] Continue the old tasks I have set out to do
-   [ ] Solve more project euler problems
-   [ ] Print out a z-table with a bit more accuracy this time
-   [ ] Write out the solutions to picoCTF's past challenges in C
        (I didn't participate in any sadly)
