# Random Code
Random code for my own fun, and to solve some ctf or other challenges.

## Building the stuff I made
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/croisen/c-random-code.git"
cd c-random-code/
make
```

## Todo
- [x] Write an argument parser for a main file that runs a solution for a project euler problem.
- [x] Try to solve more project euler problems and add it to the func_exec.h (18, 19, 21-30)
- [ ] Try out using CMake
- [ ] Write solutions for some picoCTF problems in c because why not. (This seems like a bad idea now)
- [ ] Finish the code for the creation of the z-table (become proficient at calculus and lib mpfr :( ).
