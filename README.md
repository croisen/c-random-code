# Random Scripts
Random scripts for my own fun

## Carrier Who
```
-> Pass the first four digit of a cellphone number, it will return who's the carrier of said number.
From the Philippines only though.
```

## Gelbooru
```
-> Pass some tags for the image you wanna search in gelbooru.
Tags are to be seperated by spaces (ie. hello world)
Tags that has spaces but is counted as one tag (how to explain this), is to be joined by underscores (ie. fire_emblem)
```

## Get Album Art
```
-> Searches through the current directory for mp3 files and searches through youtube for a thumbnail.
Uses ffmpeg to add the thumbnail as cover art for the mp3 file.
```

## Image convert
```
-> As reddit gives me webm files disguised as jpegs, my laptop can't read it sadly. So I made this to automatically convert them to png files. Uses ImageMagick's convert tool.
```

## Karaoke Scoring
```
-> Uses the pygame module for python to open a window that will display a score like how a karaoke does it.
Requires the file inside the file-dependency folder to work with sound.
```

## Landscape wallpaper && Portrait wallpaper
```
-> Uses ImageMagick's convert tool to resize pictures to my laptop or phone's screen size.
```

## Mass rename ascending numbers
```
-> Automatically renames files to numbers
```

## Nsfw Cli
```
-> A script I've gotten from pystardust's ani-cli support server, it will download doujins from nhentai.net when you give it a doujin number
```

## Nuke Exif
```
-> Uses exiftool to nuke the exif data contained inside pictures
```

## Pillow Test
```
-> Surprisingly this is still here, well this was supposed to replace portrait and landscape wallpaper but, I don't know how to use the PIL module for python to resize images. My attempts resulted in nothing.
```

## Project Euler
```
-> My attempt to solve the problems at project euler, I solved the first 10 problems, it's not much but I'm proud
```

## Snake game
```
-> Uses the pygame module to make the classic snake game
```

## Spinning Donut
```
-> A spinning donut made by RandomThings23
His github - https://github.com/RandomThings23
```

## That Novel Corner Unzip
```
-> Fast unzip of the zip files provided by thatnovelcorner, no I was not feeling lazy unzipping the 39 volumes of Rokujouma no Shinryakusha.
```
